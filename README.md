# Stori - Uniting Voices, Crafting Tales

Stori is an online platform with a focus on transparency and the option for users to share ideas, stories, or thoughts anonymously. The platform is versatile, and the objective of its use is User-Dependent! People could use it to seek help anonymously within the community, in certain situations of their lives, or could spread joy with artistic thoughts or stories they could think of. This platform is not only for the writers of the world, but for the thinkers and fighters of the daily circus of society. This is the safe-space every shrink tries to boast about!

## Primary Features:

### Decade-wise Age Filtration: 
Users can filter content based on the age group the content is relatable to. While posting, the user will be asked about the relatability of the project in regard to the age group. If the content can be read by all age groups, an option will be provided.

### Article Section: 
Daily short news in the writing industry.

### Posts: 
Creating a post as well as commenting on it.

## Conclusion:

The primary goal of Stori is to provide a platform where individuals can freely express themselves, share their creativity, and connect with others in a supportive and inclusive environment. By providing a space for transparent yet anonymous expression, Stori aims to inspire creativity, build connections, and celebrate the diversity of stories within its community.
